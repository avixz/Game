# Missile Command

Missile Command is a 1980 arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and licensed to Sega for European release. It was designed by Dave Theurer, who also designed Atari's vector graphics game Tempest from the same year. The 1981 Atari 2600 port of Missile Command by Rob Fulop sold over 2.5 million copies and became the third most popular cartridge for the system.

## Game Requirements

* The game must have:
  * Start screen
  * Key to return to the start screen
  * Score system
  * Graphics representative and capturing the spirit of a Missile Command clone
  * Sound effects

* While single player is the goal, a multiplayer mode is also acceptable
* Gameplay mechanics in the spirit of Missile Command - the game does not need to be an exact clone, but it does need to have Missile Command gameplay
